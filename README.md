# Graphics Project #1: Basic 3D Scene

This solution was created using Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16 Toolset v142.

The project is currently configured to be build in Debug and Release mode, both on x64 architecture.

Currently you can only run this project through Visual Studio Solution.

There's console output with information about the application only when using Debug Configuration.

The user inputs expected when using the application are:
- Press WASDQE to move the Camera Eye.
- Use the ImGui UI to make any changes to the currenty scene

Know Issues:
- Is it possible to for the application to freeze when manipulating the UI. There's seems to be an issue with the backends of the ImGui and my application.
- Even though its rare, it may happen and as of now I just restart the application and resume what I was doing.
